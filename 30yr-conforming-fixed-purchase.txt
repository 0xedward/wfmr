**** Important disclosures, assumptions and APR Information ****
*** General Disclosures ***
    * If the down payment is less than 20%, mortgage insurance may be required
      and could increase the monthly payment and APR. The payment amount does
      not include homeowners insurance, flood insurance (if applicable), or
      property taxes that must be paid in addition to your loan payment.
    * The displayed Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is a measure of the cost to
      borrow money expressed as a yearly percentage. For mortgage loans,
      excluding home equity lines of credit, it includes the interest rate plus
      other charges or fees (such as mortgage insurance, discount points, and
      origination charges). For home equity lines, the APR simply reflects the
      interest rate. When shopping for a mortgage, you can use the APR to
      compare the costs of similar loans between lenders.
    * We based the mortgage interest rates shown on a 45-day rate lock period.
      Under certain circumstances, a 45-day rate lock may not be available.
      When you apply you can choose to lock or float your interest rate range.
      Learn_more about your rate lock options and costs.
    * These mortgage rates are based upon a variety of assumptions and
      conditions, which include a consumer credit score that may be higher or
      lower than your individual credit score. Your loan's interest rate will
      depend upon the specific characteristics of your loan transaction and
      your credit history up to the time of closing.
    * The estimated total closing costs above do not constitute and are not a
      substitute for a loan estimate, which includes an estimate of closing
      costs you will receive once you apply for a loan. The amounts provided
      above for Estimated Total Closing Costs, are estimations based on the
      state selected. This is NOT a mortgage loan approval or commitment to
      lend. The actual fees, costs, and monthly payment on your specific loan
      transaction may vary, and may include city, county, or other additional
      fees and costs.

***** Fully Indexed Payment *****
The amount of the principal and interest payment calculated when using the
fully indexed rate.
***** Fully Indexed Interest Rate *****
The fully indexed interest rate is equal to the margin plus the index (an
economic indicator used to determine changes in the interest rate).
***** First Adjusted Payment *****
After the end of the initial fixed-rate period, the first adjusted payment
reflects the new principal and interest payment that's due each month on an
adjustable-rate mortgage. Future payments can’t be predicted, so it’s estimated
using the first adjusted interest rate. Interest rate adjustments may
significantly increase or decrease the payment amount due.
***** First Adjusted Interest Rate *****
Estimate of the new interest rate on an adjustable-rate loan when it first
adjusts after the fixed-rate period. Future rates can't be predicted, so it's
estimated by adding the current index rate to the margin (subject to first
adjustment cap).
***** Jumbo *****
A loan that exceeds Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's loan limits. Also called a
non-conforming loan.
Larger Loan Amounts in Eligible Areas
In federally designated metropolitan areas, conventional and FHA loan limits
have been increased to assist homebuyers.
***** Government *****
A loan that is either backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or a
VA loan for eligible service members and veterans.
***** Conventional Conforming Mortgage *****
Conventional home mortgages eligible for sale and delivery to either the
Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC).
***** Annual Percentage Rate (APR) *****
The cost to borrow money expressed as a yearly percentage. For mortgage loans,
excluding home equity lines of credit, it includes the interest rate plus other
charges or fees. For home equity lines, the APR is just the interest rate.
***** Interest Rate *****
The cost a customer pays to a lender for borrowing funds over a period of time
expressed as a percentage rate of the loan amount.

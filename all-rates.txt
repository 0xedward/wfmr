***** Common questions about mortgage rates *****
   How are interest rates determined? How_are_interest_rates_determined?


Interest rates are influenced by the financial markets and can change daily –
or multiple times within the same day. The changes are based on many different
economic indicators in the financial markets. 
    What’s an interest rate lock? What’s_an_interest_rate_lock?


Mortgage interest rates may change many times every day. Choosing when to lock
your interest rate is an important part of the home financing process. Learn
more_about_interest_rate_lock_options.
    Can I get a lower interest rate? Can_I_get_a_lower_interest_rate?


You may be able to lower your interest rate by making changes that lower your
risk factors described above. Here are some of the things you may want to
consider:
    * Putting more money down and lowering the LTV ratio.
    * Clearing any errors on your credit report.
    * Adding a co-signer with additional income and/or a higher credit score to
      support the loan. (For this option, you may need to start a new loan
      application.)
    * Changing the number of years of your loan term.
    * You also may be able to lower your rate by paying discount points.
    What things may affect my interest rate? What_things_may_affect_my_interest
rate?


We consider a variety of factors when we determine the interest rate and costs
of your loan. The process of reviewing these factors to determine your rate is
called "risk-based pricing."
The typical factors we look at include:
    * Credit profile: We'll obtain a credit report that shows your current
      debts and payment history. The report will also include a credit score
      based on your overall credit history.
    * Property type: Investment properties, condominiums, and multifamily homes
      are generally considered to be higher risks than single family detached
      homes.
    * Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio: The amount you want to borrow compared to the
      appraised value of the property. Generally, the lower your LTV ratio, the
      lower your interest rate and costs.
    * Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: The amount of your mortgage payments and
      total debt payments compared to your income. A higher DTI ratio may mean
      higher interest rates and costs.
    * Type of loan: Purchase versus refinance, an adjustable rate versus fixed
      rate, or cash-out refinance versus rate-and-term refinance, may affect
      overall risk.
Some other things that may affect your interest rate:
    * Closing cost credits: You may be able to finance a portion of your
      closing costs as part of your loan. This may result in a higher interest
      rate.
    * Discount points: A discount point is paid to obtain a lower interest rate
      that may reduce your monthly payment amount.
    * Asset-Based Relationship Discount: For jumbo loans, you may qualify for a
      rate discount based on the balance of your eligible assets at Wells Fargo
      Bank, N.A. and/or Wells Fargo Advisors,. Refer to your Customer Rate
      Discount Disclosure in your initial disclosure package for additional
      details on the Asset-Based Relationship Discount.
    * Additional risk factors: We may also consider other risk factors when
      determining your interest rate and costs, including previous
      bankruptcies, foreclosures, or unpaid judgments.
